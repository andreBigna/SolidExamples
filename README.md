# SOLID Principles Examples

![SOLID Principles](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/SOLID_Principles.svg/500px-SOLID_Principles.svg.png)

## Overview
This repository provides examples demonstrating the **SOLID** principles of software design. The SOLID principles, introduced by Robert C. Martin, are essential guidelines for writing maintainable and scalable object-oriented software.

## SOLID Principles
The acronym **SOLID** stands for:

1. **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP) - A class should have only one reason to change.
2. **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP) - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP) - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting correctness.
4. **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP) - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
5. **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP) - Depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

```
SolidExamples/
│-- SingleResponsibilityPrinciple/
│-- OpenClosedPrinciple/
│-- LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple/
│-- InterfaceSegregationPrinciple/
│-- DependencyInversionPrinciple/
│-- README.md
```
Each directory contains an example demonstrating the respective SOLID principle with well-commented code.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/andreBigna/SolidExamples.git
   ```
2. Navigate to a principle's directory.
3. Open the example files in your preferred IDE.
4. Run and analyze the code to understand the principle in practice.

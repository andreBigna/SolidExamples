SRP: Single Responsibility Principle
"A class should have only one reason to change."

By concentrating multiple responsibilities in a single class, rigidity and coupling between different behaviors are introduced. A change in requirements for one of these behaviors could lead to modifications in the same class and potentially affect parts of the code that are not necessarily related to the intended change.

In short: The more likely it is that requirements will change for one of the classâ€™s responsibilities, the more necessary it becomes to decouple them.

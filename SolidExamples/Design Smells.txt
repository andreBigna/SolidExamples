Design Smells
Just like Code Smells, they are not actual bugs, but rather a set of structural flaws that make a project unstable and difficult to maintain, along with other more subtle issues.

Specifically, Design Smells include:

    Rigidity: Difficulty in making even the smallest modificationâ€” the more parts of the software that need to be adjusted, the more rigid the software becomes.

    Fragility: The tendency of the software to "break" in places other than those modified, even if they are not conceptually related.

    Immobility: The inability to reuse code that could potentially be useful in other parts of the project because it is too risky and/or difficult to refactor.

    Viscosity: A characteristic of software where it is easier to make modifications without following the design (viscosity of code) or without relying on the development environment due to its inefficiency (viscosity of environment). In other words, when it is easier to do the wrong thing than the right one.

    Needless Complexity: This occurs when developers try to anticipate potential problems and/or changes in requirements, overloading the software with unnecessary and unused structures.

    Needless Repetition: Code that is copied and pasted instead of being refactored, creating multiple possible inconsistencies in case of future modifications.

    Opacity: Software written in an unclear way, full of Code Smells, making it difficult to understand and therefore hard to modify.
